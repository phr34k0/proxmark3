# Building on Windows
You will need to use the Gator96100 Proxspace package to assist in your windows installation.
This can be downloaded from https://github.com/Gator96100/ProxSpace/

## Notes
If you receive gcc errors using v3.1 during build, download and use v2.2. This may help resolve the issue.

- https://github.com/Gator96100/ProxSpace/releases/tag/v3.1   (release v3.1 with gcc v7.3.0 )
- https://github.com/Gator96100/ProxSpace/releases/tag/v2.2   (release v2.2 with gcc v5.3.0 arm-none-eabi-gcc v7.1.0)
